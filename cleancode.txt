Readability:

My code is generally easy to read as well as easy to understand. The Variable and function names are self explainatory, whcih makes it clear what each part of the code is doing.

Modularity:
Functions and classes are created for to make tasks simple as well as re-usable to promote modularity. Each part of the code has a specific task which makes it easier to maintain modify and re-use. Functions such as get_block , jump, load_sprites can be used multiple times and can be called with modifications to make loading items easier.

Consistent Naming:
The Naming Conventions of Variables,Classes and Functions are consistent all through the code which makes reading and understanding the individual parts as well easy and consistent.
Block,Player,Fire,Animations,move,load,jump etc are variables and class names to help with consistency.

Indentation:
I have used proper indentation, adhering to Python's syntax requirements. This contributes to the overall readability of the code.

Appropriate Data Structures:
I am using of lists, dictionaries, and classes appears for the processing tasks at hand. This helps in organizing and managing the data as well as fuctions effectively.

Error Handling:
Considered some error handling, such as checking for file existence before loading images as well as in os statements. Including more comprehensive error handling would enhance robustness.

Appropriate Abstraction:
The code uses abstraction effectively, encapsulating functionalities within classes and functions. This makes the code more structured and easier to explain.

Consistent Style:
The code adheres to a consistent style, which is crucial for readability and maintainability. Consistent use indentation and naming convention.

Use of Constants:
Some constants are used in the code, contributing to its clarity. For example, WIDTH, HEIGHT, and FPS are defined as constants at the beginning of the code. Constants like GRAVITY and other physics related constants are defined.
